# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Architecture Overview

Mosaic is a TypeScript monorepo for managing Token-2022 extensions on Solana, specifically designed for Stablecoin and Arcade Token use cases. The project uses pnpm workspaces and Turbo for build orchestration with the following structure:

- **@solana/mosaic-sdk** (`packages/sdk/`) - Core SDK with token templates and management utilities
    - Uses `gill` library for Solana interactions
    - Provides `Token` class for building token transactions with extensions
    - Contains predefined templates for stablecoin and arcade tokens
    - Token extensions include: Metadata, Pausable, Default Account State, Confidential Balances, Permanent Delegate
    - Key modules: issuance, management, administration, templates
- **@solana/mosaic-cli** (`packages/cli/`) - Command-line interface built with Commander.js
    - Commands: `create stablecoin`, `create arcade-token`, `mint`
    - Global options: `--rpc-url`, `--keypair`
- **@mosaic/app** (`apps/app/`) - Dashboard application (Next.js) with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI components

## Token Types

### Stablecoin

- Default Account State (SRFC blocklist for compliance)
- Metadata, Confidential Balances, Pausable, Permanent Delegate

### Arcade Token

- Default Account State (SRFC allowlist for programs/users)
- Metadata (rich gaming metadata), Permanent Delegate, Pausable

## Common Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Development (runs dev for all packages)
pnpm dev

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Testing
pnpm test              # Run all tests
pnpm test:watch        # SDK watch mode (in packages/sdk/)
pnpm test:coverage     # SDK coverage (in packages/sdk/)

# Code quality
pnpm lint              # Lint all packages
pnpm lint:fix          # Fix linting issues
pnpm format            # Format with Prettier
pnpm format:check      # Check formatting
pnpm type-check        # TypeScript checking
pnpm check             # Run format:check + lint + type-check

# Clean build artifacts
pnpm clean             # Remove dist folders from all packages

# Before committing
pnpm precommit         # format + lint:fix
```

## Package-Specific Commands

### SDK (packages/sdk/)

- Uses Jest for testing
- Main entry point exports `Token` class and templates
- Test setup in `src/__tests__/setup.ts`

```bash
cd packages/sdk
pnpm test:watch     # Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:coverage  # Generate test coverage report
```

### CLI (packages/cli/)

- Uses Commander.js for CLI framework
- Uses tsx for development execution
- Exports mosaic binary when built

```bash
cd packages/cli
pnpm dev           # Run CLI in development mode using tsx
pnpm build         # Build CLI binary
pnpm start         # Run built CLI
```

### App (apps/app/)

- Next.js 15 with App Router
- Tailwind CSS + Radix UI components
- Theme support with next-themes

```bash
cd apps/app
pnpm dev    # Start Next.js development server
pnpm build  # Build for production
pnpm start  # Start production server
```

## Development Notes

- Project is currently scaffolded - implementation depends on Token-2022 program stabilization and SRFC 37 spec
- Uses `gill` library for Solana RPC interactions
- All token creation functions return `FullTransaction` objects ready for signing
- Uses Turbo for monorepo build orchestration (faster builds with caching)
- Node.js 20+ and pnpm 10+ required
- TypeScript 5.9+ for all packages
